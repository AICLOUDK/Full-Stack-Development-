Explanation
Imports: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries (in this case, express).
App Initialization: An instance of an Express application is created.
Middleware Setup: Middleware functions are set up (like express.json()), which are common in setting up an Express app.
Basic Route: A basic route handler is defined to handle requests to the root URL.
Server Startup: Finally, the code starts listening for incoming requests on the specified port.
This pattern of initializing an Express app, setting up middleware, defining routes, and starting a server is quite common and serves as a boilerplate when creating a new web application using Express.js. Each new Express project typically starts with similar structures, saving time and effort while ensuring consistency.
