Full Stack Development
Full Stack Development refers to the process of building both the frontend (the part users interact with) and the backend (the server-side logic, database, and server management) of a web application. A full stack developer has the skills to handle all layers of a web application, from designing user interfaces to managing data and server operations.

In essence:  

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue.js)
Backend: Languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, or Java; frameworks like Express.js, Django, or Spring
Database: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
Boilerplate
Boilerplate refers to a starter code or template that provides a basic, ready-to-use foundation for building a project. It includes essential files, configurations, and structure, so developers don’t have to start from scratch.

Purpose of Boilerplate:

Save time and effort
Ensure best practices
Provide a consistent project structure
Example:
A React app created with create-react-app is a boilerplate — it sets up the basic React environment so you can start coding immediately.

How They Relate
A full stack developer may use boilerplates to quickly set up frontend or backend projects.
Boilerplates help streamline full stack development by providing a ready-made foundation, allowing developers to focus on building unique features rather than setting up basic structure.
Simple Example:
Using a boilerplate like Express.js generator to create a backend server quickly.
Using create-react-app to start a React frontend project.
