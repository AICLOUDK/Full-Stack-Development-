In programming, "boilerplate" refers to sections of code that are repeated in many places with little or no modification. These pieces of code are often used to set up a basic structure for a program or a module, providing necessary but standardized functionalities that all it requires is customization around a specific point. Boilerplate code can be tedious to write and often results in duplicated code across different parts of an application.

Boilerplate is commonly found in various programming languages and frameworks. For example, when setting up a new web application, a developer might need to write a lot of repetitive code to establish configurations, structures, or protocols that are necessary for the application to function properly.
